SystemsFair is the Engineering Career Fair at Simon Fraser University (SFU)’s Surrey Campus. Created in 2014, SystemsFair provides a venue for engineering students to meet with employers in the industry one-on-one, and get a feel for the tech community and the opportunities available to them, and for employers to scout student talent and gain exposure for their organizations.

This year SystemsFair will be collaborating with OpFair from the Burnaby Mountain Campus to host a virtual career fair, with the hopes of bringing the best experience possible for all of SFU’s Applied Sciences students. 

To learn more about this collaboration, and to get registered for this event, please check out <a href="https://www.opfair.ca/">the OpFair website.</a>

Since 1993, OpFair has been an annual career fair geared towards the students of SFU’s Faculty of Applied Sciences, which includes the Schools of Computing Science, Engineering Science, Mechatronic Systems Engineering, and our most recent addition, the School of Sustainable Energy Engineering. Our event also welcomes attendees from a variety of graduate programs such as the Professional Masters of Science in Computer Science with concentrations in Big Data, Visual Computing, and Cybersecurity.

SFU's Surrey campus is an emerging technology hub where over 800 students are working towards their MSE or SoSy degree. Companies and organizations take advantage of the co-operative education (co-op) program to recruit top mechatronics engineers and software developers from SFU, often offering internship to connect with these talents early.
