SystemsFair is the Engineering Career Fair at Simon Fraser University (SFU)’s Surrey Campus. Created in 2014, SystemsFair provides a venue for engineering students to meet with employers in the industry one-on-one, and get a feel for the tech community and the opportunities available to them, and for employers to scout student talent and gain exposure for their organizations.

In these unprecedented times, safety is our priority. Consequently, this year’s event will be held exclusively online via Hopin. This two-day event will be run in collaboration with our Burnaby Campus counterpart event, OpFair, to bring the best experience possible to all of SFU's Applied Sciences students. For companies looking to hire, this means having the opportunity to meet with students with a diverse range of skills, from both the Burnaby and Surrey Applied Science programs.

Since 1993, OpFair has been an annual career fair geared towards the students of SFU’s Faculty of Applied Sciences, which includes the Schools of Computing Science, Engineering Science, Mechatronic Systems Engineering, and our most recent addition, the School of Sustainable Energy Engineering. Our event also welcomes attendees from a variety of graduate programs such as the Professional Masters of Science in Computer Science with concentrations in Big Data, Visual Computing, and Cybersecurity.

SFU's Surrey campus is an emerging technology hub where over 800 students are working towards their MSE or SoSy degree. Companies and organizations take advantage of the co-operative education (co-op) program to recruit top mechatronics engineers and software developers from SFU, often offering internship to connect with these talents early.
