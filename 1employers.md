# What is SystemsFair?
SystemsFair (formerly MechExpo) is the Technical Career Fair at Simon Fraser University (SFU)’s Surrey Campus. Created in 2014, SystemsFair provides a venue for engineering students to meet with employers in the industry one-on-one, and get a feel for the tech community and the opportunities available to them, and for employers to scout student talent and gain exposure for their organizations.

SFU's Surrey campus is an emerging technology hub where over 800 students are working towards their MSE or SoSy degree. Companies and organizations take advantage of the co-operative education (co-op) program to recruit top mechatronics engineers and software developers from SFU, often offering internship to connect with these talents early. 


# Why should you attend?
Whether you have jobs today or will have jobs in the future, our students and alumni want to know more about your organization and potential careers. If you want to save your time and reduce your effort and recruitment costs, Join us for the opportunity to reach out to 800+ students from Mechatronic Systems Engineering and Software Systems from the faculty of applied sciences at SFU!


​SystemsFair provides an excellent opportunity for companies and industry representatives to network and engage with Simon Fraser University’s engineering students and recent graduates and promote and inform them about jobs and internships.


By attending SystemsFair, you can:
* Network with potential employees
* Inform students of career options within your organization
