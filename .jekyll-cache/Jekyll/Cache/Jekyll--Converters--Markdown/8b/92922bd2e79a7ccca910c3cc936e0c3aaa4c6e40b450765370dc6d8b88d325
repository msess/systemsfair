SFU's Surrey campus is an emerging technology hub where over 800 students are working towards their MSE or SoSy degree. Companies and organizations take advantage of the co-operative education (co-op) program to recruit top mechatronics engineers and software developers from SFU, often offering internship to connect with these talents early.
